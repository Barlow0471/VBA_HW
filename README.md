# VBA Homework
##  In this homework assignment, we were tasked with creating a script that would loop through all stocks for three separate years and output the following information.
- The ticker symbol
- Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The total stock volume of the stock.
- Conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
---
##  Our solution should also be able to return the stocks with the "Greatest % Increase", "Greatest % Decrease", and "Greatest Total Volume".

*This was a challenging project and I did save my progress regularly. However, I did not upload this to GitHub until the very end, therefore I am missing the 20+ commits that would have occurred over the length of the project.*
